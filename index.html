          <p>Algorithms and their complexities are core elements of computer science, driving innovations and efficiency across various fields. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, and its complexity refers to the resources it requires, such as time and space. Time complexity is crucial for measuring and comparing algorithm performance, predicting execution time based on input size, and selecting the most efficient algorithm for a given problem. It's typically expressed using Big O notation for a high-level understanding of performance.

            Understanding these complexities has practical implications in developing efficient software and optimizing computational resources. Despite its importance, teaching and understanding time complexity in algorithms remain challenging. This paper examines the fundamental concepts of time complexity, reviews real-world applications, and explores effective instructional methods for teaching these concepts in computer science education.

        <td colspan="0">
          <p>Students suffering from disabilities have always had a harder time performing academically than their peers. 
            For this reason, they are provided accommodations and resources to help them succeed in their studies so they can enjoy the same opportunities as any other student.
             However, even with all the progress that the education system has made regarding providing resources and helping students with disabilities to succeed academically, disabled students continue to lag behind their peers. This includes students who suffer from cognitive, psychological, and physical disabilities. Those suffering from cognitive 
             disabilities are the most affected since their rates of bachelor's degree completion are significantly lower than that of their peers, most of them dropping out based on their first-year performance. The main reason for this trend is the fact that most students
             never register with their Disability Resource Center and many who do often do it only for one semester. Not registering to use the provided resources is 
             highly prejudicial, as the use of disability accommodations is directly related to increases in GPA. <br><br>
             In today's rapidly evolving world, new technologies are constantly finding their way into all aspects of our lives, and education is no different.
              As such, this paper proposes the creation of a mobile application that can make academic resources more easily available and free of charge for all students, but specifically for students with disabilities. The app will contain 
              resources such as class notes and speech-to-text captions. These will be provided to the app by other students, who will be rewarded for their assistance. The approximate initial cost will be $200000, and an additional $25000 each year to 
              maintain the app and compensate 
              the volunteers. After the app is launched, surveys will be sent periodically to assess the quality and quantity of the content being provided to ensure that it is effective.
              Also, the number of volunteers will be monitored to ensure a constant flow of relevant material. <br><br>

              With the right funding and passionate students willing to help others, this application will make a significant impact on the academic careers of many. Making these useful resources available online means that more people will feel comfortable using them, regardless of whether they are registered in the DRC, so the app will certainly help many succeed academically.

            of sea turtles based on given parameters of length, width, and species, and
            image identification of different sea turtles species, namely Loggerhead,

          <p>Cyanobacteria is a photosynthetic microorganism that processes sunlight, nitrogen and phosphorus to live. As algae begin to form, it blocks sunlight from entering the bottom of ponds, lakes, and rivers. Without light, algae stop generating oxygen and consume it instead (earthhow.com). Visually, this results in the blankets of green often seen on stagnant and dead bodies of water and this is
             what tourists see often when they visit certain parts of the Caloosahatchee River. According to data sets in floridadep.gov, algal blooms were located in 4 locations in 2020, which increased dramatically to 21 locations in 2021. It can be inferred that the rates of pollution of the river are increasing steeply, which are causing these rapid and destructive algal blooms.

          <p>Errors are an unavoidable part of coding, whether that be in a personal project a singular student is creating, or whether it be an industrially made application. There are different classifications of these errors and in the software space, they are usually called “bugs”. Not all bugs are equally damaging to the infrastructure. 
            An example of a common bug which can cause complicated vulnerabilities and chances of memory leaks is the Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow vulnerability (IO2BO), which arises from integer overflows during memory allocation calculations. This results in inadequate memory allocation, triggering potential buffer overflow issues.

This showed me the incredible impact microbes have on societies around the globe, giving me a much bigger picture of how microbiology shapes our world. <br><br>
Loved the fusion of microbiology and cultural studies in "Microbes without Borders"! To make it even more amazing, incorporating real-life examples of how microbes affect us globally and encouraging discussions with people from diverse backgrounds would be fantastic. <br><br>
Connecting the Dots: A Perfect Match for My Future!  "Microbes without Borders" wasn't just fascinating, it directly connects to my career goals in computer science and data analysis for healthcare. Understanding how microbes influence entire populations is a treasure trove of data waiting to be explored. I can see myself applying this knowledge to analyze trends, predict outbreaks, and develop new tools to improve global health – that's incredibly exciting! <br><br>

          <p>This paper discusses the challenges faced by the bread industry and consumers
            due to bread spoilage and staling. Mold growth and staling are the main causes of
            bread spoilage, leading to economic losses for both the industry and consumers. The
            article discusses the factors that affect mold growth and bread staling, including
            temperature, humidity, moisture content, and storage. The aim of the experiment is to
            document the rate of staling and molding of bread under different conditions to
            determine the effect of temperature, humidity, and moisture content on bread. The
            paper concludes by highlighting the importance of natural extracts as an alternative to
            synthetic additives in the bread industry and the need for more effective measures
            against bread staling. The experiment shows that all the specimens become stale, and
            although none of the specimens had a change in color during the duration of the
            experiment, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of measures taken against
            staling compared to that against mold and implications of that in terms of the
            environment and food waste.
